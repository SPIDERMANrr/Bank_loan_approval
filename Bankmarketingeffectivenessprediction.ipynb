Admittedly some of the following might blur together a bit at the edges but the aim is to give a flavour.\n","\n","1. Our data are too big. 4 million rows. 50,000 columns… is there a lot of redundancy there? Building a model on this could be very expensive. Even relatively simple dimension reduction techniques like PCA can capture almost all of the information in a fraction of the memory if there are strong relationships (that can be linearly approximated) in the data.\n","\n","2. We are over-fitting. If you build a model with tens of thousands of degrees of freedom but don’t have a lot of examples you can easily overfit. Dimension reduction is one way of handling this, though often not the the best\n","\n","3. We want to bring in external data. OK, this is a bit different but worth a note. In applications like word2vec we want to build a classifier using an embedding. We may want to classify some text into different categories but with only a limited number of examples. The complexity of free text is vast but a low dimension embedding is much smaller and will not overfit so badly in a classifier. Building a low dimensional embedding on external text, applying it to the text to be classified then building a classifier is using dimension reduction to bring in external data.\n","\n","4. We suffer from the curse of dimesnionality. Consider something like a nearest neighbour search. As the number of dimensions gets large we see some unwanted behaviour, especially if we are looking at things like euclidean distances. Projecting your data to a lower dimensional space for nearest neighbour, clustering or outlier detection can be both more robust and more meaningful.\n","\n","5. Some tools are all about this. Collaborative filtering through matrix factorisation is an example. Can we approximately describe behaviour as a linear combination of a smaller number of preferences/behaviours?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"P1XJ9OREExlT"},"source":["### 8.
